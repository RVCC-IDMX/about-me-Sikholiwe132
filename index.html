    <h5>Report on Variable Fonts</h5>

    <div>
        <p>Variable fonts can be defined as an evolution of the open type font specification that allows various variations of a typeface to be incorporated into a single file as opposed to having individual font files for every width, weight or style. Through a single font face reference, you are able to access diverse fonts in a given font file via CSS (DOCS, 2022). Variable fonts disregard the explicit distinction between different weights and styles and grant the ability to for the user to choose how heavy, slanted or wide the open type should be. The benefit of combining different font variations into one is it reduces the file size by a significant amount in contrast to loading multiple individual font files. Another way to think of a variable font is to picture a slider (also referred to as an axis) with the lightest weight (usually thin or extra light) at one end regular in the middle and the heaviest weight (also referred to as ExtraBold or Black. Previously users would have to choose from specific points of the scale whereas any point of the scale can now be used (Stocks, EJ, 2022). </p>
        <p>The earliest forms of variable fonts were developed in the 1990’s between Apple, Google, Microsoft and Adobe however have existed as we know them since 2016. It originated in Apples TrueType GX font variations and the technology was them adapted OpenType as OpenType variable fonts (OTVF) in version 1.8 of the OpenType specification. Developing such a feature has paved the way for many software platforms (Murphy, 2021). So how are they used? As previously mentioned, the various permutations of variable fonts can be contained in a single file thus allowing the user to have access to an entire range of weights, widths, and styles as opposed to being restricted to the few that would have been previously loaded separately. </p>
        <p>This allows for common typographic techniques such as setting different size headings in different weights for better readability at each size or using a slightly narrower width for data-dense displays. For instance, magazines utilize 10-15 or more different weight and width variations throughout their publications allowing for a wider range of styles then those that are typical on the web which is typical in a typographic system.</p>
        <p>The concept of an axis of variation is the foundation of the new variable font formats as it describes the allowable range of that particular aspect of the typeface design. In other words, the weight axis refers to how light or bold the letterforms can be, the width refers to how narrow or wide they can be and the italics refers to if whether or not italic letter forms are present and can be turned on and off. With regards to axes there are two types namely registered axes which are axes that are most frequently encountered and common such that the authors have standardized them (weight, width, slant, italic, and optical size) and custom axes which are limitless meaning the typeface designer can define and scope any axis they like and are just required to give it a four-letter tag to identify it within the font file format itself both of which are used in CSS.</p>
